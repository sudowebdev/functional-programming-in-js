# Functional Programming in JS

## What is it?

In Functional Programming, **functions are treated as values**. 
Just like, we can assign a value to any variable, 
in the same way we can assign **functions to variables**. 
And also, we can pass a **function as an argument** and **return a 
function** (the same behaviour that exists with values).

## Higher Order Functions

A higher-order function is a function that can take 
**another function as an argument**, or that **returns a function as a result**.
