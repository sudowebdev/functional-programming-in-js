# Functional Programming in JS

## What is it?

In Functional Programming, **functions are treated as values**. 
Just like, we can assign a value to any variable, 
in the same way we can assign **functions to variables**. 
And also, we can pass a **function as an argument** and **return a 
function** (the same behaviour that exists with values).

## Higher Order Functions

A higher-order function is a function that can take 
**another function as an argument**, or that **returns a function as a result**.

Aim is to make your code **composable**.

## What are First-Class citizens?

In programming languages, when you are able to **pass, return and assign** a type, 
that **type** is considered to be a **first class citizen**.

**Types** inside of Javascript are first class citizens, we are able to assign, 
pass and return **all the different types** in JS.

## Difference between map and filter function.

**map** is used to transform values inside an array and put
them into another array.  
Whereas, **filter** only returns a filtered array. It doesn't do 
any modification.
