# Functional Programming in JS

## What is it?

In Functional Programming, **functions are treated as values**. Just like, we can assign a value to any variable, in the same way we can assign **functions to variables**. And also, we can pass a **function as an argument** and **return a function** (the same behaviour that exists with values).
